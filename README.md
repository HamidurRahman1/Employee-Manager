# Employee Manager

<pre>A simple java project where different employee are managed differently.
Employee kinds are Hourly, Salaried.

A employee is always managed by a manager. Where manager can adas many as employee
into a project and remove them when needed.

By calling a static method all employee's salary can be raised.

This project's intention was to do practice with <strong>Interface and Base classes.</strong>

Note:
When an user creates Employee objects, they must enter unique ID for each employee. 
ID range distinguish between different employees.

		ID #: 100 <= Manager <= 999;
		ID #: 1000 <= Salaried Employee <= 4999;
		ID #: 5000 <= Hourly Employee <= 9999;

Usage of Database would have been make it easier to create role based employee creation.
